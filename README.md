Java Snake
==========

## Disclaimer

This is one of my first Java projects I did around 2010, so it's far away from modern coding standards.

I'd like to open source some of my work, because I like these games and it could inspire young java developer trainees.

## About the game

This is a Java port of *Snake*.

## Development

Start the game

```
$ mvn exec:java
```

Build the project and create a runnable JAR

```
$ mvn package
```

## License

This bundle is under the [MIT license](LICENSE.md).
